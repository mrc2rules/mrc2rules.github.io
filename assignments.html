<p><em>Date: 20 November 2025 | Course: SECP1513 - Technology Information System</em></p>
<p>I attended an industry talk by PPG Malaysia Technology Center (MYTC) as part of my SECP1513 course. It gave me an in-depth look at how large-scale digital operations are run in a global company. The session explored how data analytics, cloud infrastructure, and enterprise systems work together to drive efficiency, scalability, and innovation.</p>
<p>I learned about real-world applications like the Global Marine Heart Navigator for supply chain management, multi-source enterprise data analytics, and machine learning operations. The talk also highlighted cloud strategies using AWS, Azure, VMware, Oracle Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud, showing how distributed IT teams maintain 24/7 support, secure networks, and scalable platforms.</p>
<p>On the ERP side, I learned how SAP S/4HANA supports different streams—finance, supply chain, production planning, and order-to-cash—demonstrating how interconnected enterprise systems ensure smooth global operations. The Plan-Build-Run model helped visualize how architecture, infrastructure, and operations teams collaborate to deliver reliable services across regions.</p>
<p>The industry talk gave me a better understanding of how analytics, cloud infrastructure, and enterprise systems skills play a part in ICT roles. It reinforced the importance of combining technical expertise with process-driven thinking to make global digital transformation possible.</p>

<p><em>Date: 12 November 2025 | Course: SECP1513 - Technology Information System</em></p>
<p>I participated in a hands-on PC assembly and disassembly session as part of my SECP1513 course. Under the supervision of lab assistants, we examined key internal components, carefully disassembled the internal PC components, later reassembled it step by step, and tested the system to ensure it functioned correctly. This practical, hands-on approach helped reinforce our understanding of hardware architecture and how individual components work together within a system.</p>
<p>The class ended with a theoretical quiz based on the activity we just completed in order to assess our understanding in class. Overall, it was a fun memorable session which enhanced my understanding of computer hardware through a practical, hands-on experience.</p>

</div>

<p><em>Date: 28 October 2025 | Course: SECP1513 - Technology Information System</em></p>
<p>I attended the UTMDigital Open Day 2025 at Blok D07, UTM Johor Bahru and it turned out to be far more insightful than I expected! The open day featured a wide range of booths from UTMDigital's industry partners, including Microsoft, Archibus, Axis, Enfrasys, Canon, Dell Technologies, and Oracle Academy. Exploring these booths gave me valuable exposure to real-world digital solutions currently shaping industries in Malaysia and globally. I also had the opportunity to engage directly with staff and conduct interviews, allowing me to gain deeper insight into how these technologies are applied in practice.</p>
<p>One of the highlights was attending the Oracle Academy talk by Sir Mohd Asrul bin Mohamad Zin at the Bilik Ruckus hall. The session provided a clear overview of Oracle Academy's global education initiatives, including certifications and courses in databases, cloud computing, Java, and emerging AI programs. The talk was especially beneficial for students interested in cybersecurity and cloud-related career paths and highlighted Oracle's role in connecting Malaysian higher education institutions with leading enterprises across Asia.</p>
<p>At the Dell Technologies booth, I got to check out their rugged laptops and we were even allowed to throw it on the floor! (ps. it still worked!) The D-RON booth stood out as well, showcasing camera sensory technology capable of monitoring temperature and humidity, with ongoing development in areas such as facial recognition.</p>
<p>Overall, the UTMDigital Open Day allowed us to gain exposure to new companies and services they offer, and how they're working to benefit students.</p>

<p>This project taught me about the Design Thinking methodology and how it can be employed to create useful solutions for users by following certain phases like empathy, define, ideation, prototype and testing phase. It helped me learn how to tackle problems in a better manner and become competent at designing systems without any presumptions regarding users.</p>
